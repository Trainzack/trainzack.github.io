I"—<p>This website is a portfolio of all of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on. Over the time to come, I intend to update it with projects Iâ€™ve worked on in the past and any new projects to come.</p>

<p>I decided to use Jekyll to make this site, in no small part because GitHub strongly suggested it. Iâ€™m glad I did, because Jekyll is exactly the tool that I never knew I needed to make static sites. Iâ€™ve made websites before in raw HTML and CSS (like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181118194139/http://www.cpp.edu/~pepband/">CPP Pep Band Website</a>) , but that method gets weighted down with bloat incredibly quickly.</p>

<p>Later, I helped make a video streaming website for my Software Engineering class, and that used Django. I fell in love with Djangoâ€™s templating system, but requires a dynamic site. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so glad to have found Jekyll.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, this website is just the barebones. It doesnâ€™t make sense to me to spend any more time improving it before I have anything substantial here. You can find the source code of the site at <a href="https://github.com/Trainzack/trainzack.github.io">the Github page</a>.</p>
