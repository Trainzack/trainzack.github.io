*This Is Mispirnted on the Concert Program* for Percussion Quartet was written over 8 weeks in the spring of 2018 for a composition seminar class at Cal Poly Pomona. The piece, written for vibraphone, marimba, and mixed percussion, features bowed vibraphone and is under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

The parts and score were written in Musescore, and the performance notes were written in LaTeX. *Mispirnted* was premiered on May 15th, 2018 by the LA Percussion Quartetâ€”sadly, with no written concert program distributed. Whether that fact validates or invalidates the title of the work is up to you.
